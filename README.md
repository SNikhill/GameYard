A Dark Themed, Grid Based Web Interface that shows how, a Game Store website needs to have a "game" like cool vibe to the design.

## About this project

This project is a non-responsive layout I made. It is actually one of the very first stand-out layouts I made.
I just found about CSS Grid and thought of using the same. I haven't stopped using CSS Grid since then.
Clearly, the layout is non-responsive and infact, I am not even sure whether I am allowed to use the videos / images I used.

I just slapped a copyright symbol, my name and a year at the end.

Along with CSS grid, I really wanted to use Slider. Like, I never had the opportunity to integrate it with something 
hence, I used this project as a means for the same. I created a slider using JS. Just, JavaScript and DOM handling using jQuery. 
It turned out to be a great learning experience.

## Talking a bit about the code

If you will look at the code, you will find out that it ain't perfect and I will agree with you.
In case, you are wondering why I didn't improve or document it even after I have acquired the ability to do so.
Well, I won't improve it. I believe that the mistakes in this project are an important thing from my past as a beginner.
I am proud of the mistakes I made as, they are things that helped me seek out something better and improve myself.
